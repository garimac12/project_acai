Data Scientists Income Stats

For Project 1, we utilized a dataset sourced from Kaggle related to "Data Science Salaries". 

The team comprised of 5 members: Amna Hassan, ​Garima Chaudhary, Nameeta Tiwari, ​Nidhi Nigam and Sahil Wadhwa​. 

We conducted a collaborative discussion via Zoom, during which we reviewed the dataset as a team and allocated tasks based on the available variables. Each team member was responsible for conducting univariate and bivariate/multivariate analyses, depending on the complexity and nature of the variables in the dataset. 

Our team engaged in thorough discussions, with each member actively sharing their individual analysis notebooks. Through collaborative deliberation, we collectively defined our approach to analyzing the dataset, ensuring comprehensive coverage of all relevant variables. To consolidate, we merged our individual contributions into a single notebook."

The merged notebook file displays each team member's analyses and contribution, with their respective names. As a team, we collectively identified key insights from these analyses to feature in our presentation slides. We recorded the presentation, which we then shared with both the instructor and TAs."
