THe data science salaries file was used as a dataset from kaggle for project 1. the team comprised of 5 members: Amna Hassan, ​Garima Chaudhary, Nameeta Tiwari, ​Nidhi Nigam and Sahil Wadhwa​. We discussed the data file among us by zoom call collaboration and distributed the work by giving everyone few univariuate analysis and few bi-variate or multivariate analysis based on the number of variables available to study. Everyone discussed with each other and conlcuded on the approach of analysis by sharing the individual notebooks and finally merged the work on one notebook file to ensure that we covered all teh aspects of possible variable analysis. The merged notebook file shows everyones analyses under their names and we together picked few analysis as key points on the slides and shared the recording of presentation with the instructor and TAs.
